    <h1>Disclaimer</h1>

    <p><strong>Guidance only.</strong> This tool provides weather-based guidance to help plan exterior painting or staining. It does not guarantee results and does not replace product label instructions or professional judgment.</p>

    <h2>Important limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local conditions vary.</strong> Forecasts may not reflect conditions at your exact job site (sun vs shade, elevation, wind exposure, proximity to water, and microclimates).</li>
      <li><strong>Surface and substrate matter.</strong> Surface temperature can differ from air temperature. Substrate moisture, dew, frost, and condensation can make conditions unsafe even if the forecast looks favorable.</li>
      <li><strong>Product-specific requirements override.</strong> Always follow the manufacturer’s label for temperature, humidity, curing time, recoat windows, and precipitation exposure. When in doubt, follow the stricter rule.</li>
      <li><strong>Timing assumptions.</strong> Recommendations are based on forecast time steps and conservative thresholds. Short-lived changes can occur between forecast hours.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>No liability</h2>
    <p>You assume all risk for project planning and execution. By using this site, you agree that the site owner and contributors are not responsible for damages, losses, or project outcomes.</p>

    <h2>Data sources</h2>
    <p>Forecast and geocoding data are provided by third-party services (for example, Open-Meteo). Availability and accuracy are not guaranteed.</p>
